## Best days to go to the gym?

Being a workout addict, I am going to determine the best days to go the gym using the gradient descent algorithim. It will take data from a campus gym that has 60,000 observations, with each observation giving us the number of people present at the gym. Using all the features available and implementing the gradient descent algorithim on it we can determine the best days to go to have a good workout and minimize the time in the gym.
